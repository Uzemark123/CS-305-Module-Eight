# CS-305-Module-Eight
Portfolio post for CS305
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a security-focused analysis and enhancement of their web application to mitigate vulnerabilities and improve the encryption, authentication, and secure communication layers within their software.

 I effectively identified and remediated security vulnerabilities in the application, applying secure coding principles to protect against potential threats; secure coding is essential for safeguarding data and maintaining user trust, which is vital for a companyâ€™s reputation and operational stability.

  Conducting the vulnerability assessment was insightful, particularly in identifying hidden weaknesses in data handling, which deepened my understanding of security protocols and best practices.

  I increased security layers by implementing AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 hashing, HTTPS, and removing hardcoded sensitive data; in the future, I would make even more use of comprehensive tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and threat modeling to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigations.

   I verified the functionality and security of the code through extensive testing and code review; after refactoring, I conducted further tests and analysis to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

   Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, HTTPS, and techniques in cryptography and secure configuration management were invaluable and will be useful for future assignments.

    I would showcase my approach to security vulnerability assessment, code refactoring, and the successful implementation of industry-standard encryption and secure configuration practices to demonstrate my skills in secure coding and application security.
